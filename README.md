# BRCI-text_lib.py
text_lib.py, a showcase of what BRCI can do, as well as a library using it that might have *some* uses.

To begin, clone this repository, then uncompress/unzip it. Note that this machine is running Windows 10 Home. 7zip is advised, even if this doesn't warrant it.
Then, put it in the parent directory of the BRCI directory (basically, make sure it looks like this, both files being next to the BRCI folder)

Then, make a folder called "Projects," so it now looks like *this*:

Finally, run examplefile.py, and let it generate an example for you!

You may change anything in examplefile.py of course, tinker with a few things, like the text that will be output. Be sure to read the documentation of text_lib.split_text_bricks() (I **heavily** advise using VSCode as it doesn't complain about things like Pycharm and pops the documentation up while you type the arguments in)
